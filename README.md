# AITRAX: AI-Based Lung Disease Detection System
AITRAX is an AI-powered system designed to aid in the early detection of lung diseases, with a primary focus on pulmonary fibrosis. This project leverages deep learning to analyze medical images such as CT scans, helping healthcare professionals diagnose and monitor lung conditions with higher precision and speed.

Overview
Pulmonary fibrosis and other lung diseases are challenging to detect in their early stages. AITRAX aims to provide a reliable, AI-driven solution for diagnosing these diseases, potentially improving patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention.

AITRAX uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) optimized for medical image analysis. By inputting a lung CT scan or X-ray, the model processes the image to predict the presence and severity of lung abnormalities.
